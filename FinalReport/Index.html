            <hr>
            <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>1. Team Name</strong></h1>
            <p>Our team name MKLP , which is a combination of the names of every member of our group (Minh, Khai,Long and Phat), is a special and individual way to make our group stand out. We may bring you a sense of cohesion and togetherness while respecting the uniqueness of each team member by putting our member’s name into one single object.
            </p>
            <p>The importance of diversity is shown in our team name. We can operate well together despite our differences in age. It is critical that everyone on our team be able to contribute to the project. Because we lack a team leader, every role in our group is the same. This allows us to create strong bonds with one another, which allows us to do our task on time and with great quality.
            </p>
            <p>This can also help us stand out in a world where there are numerous innovative team names. Having a unique name like this can assist us in making an impression on customers. This may cause consumers to remember our brand for a longer period of time, which can be quite advantageous in terms of marketing.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, our name is a method to embrace variety and togetherness while also making an impression on customers. Because this is our first project at university, we want to make something unique.

            <p>Interest in topic: I have just recently started working out in the gym. Fitness starts being more popular in daily life. Buying supplements and equipment is common for every athlete if they demand for the best results. However, not all retailers specify which products are appropriate for each physical condition. Moreover, instead of telling how to use the product in detail. They just give a brief instruction, which is why I would like to establish a website to provide consumers with the best personalized service.</p>

            <p>Date of birth: 16/07/2004.</p>
            <p>Contact number: 0812888246.</p>
            <p>Interest in topic: I regularly go to the gym and use my free time to practice soft skills like cooking and self-learning. I picked up cooking so I could manage the calories and nutrients in my food. Additionally, visiting the gym helps me live a healthy lifestyle. I have observed people struggling to perform physical activities in incorrect stances. Therefore, creating this website was the finest thing I could have done.</p>
            <p>Relevant skills: Logical Thinking, Well-Organized, Self-Learning and Adaptability, Python</p>
            <p>Role in this project: I designed the website, specifically, the Machine sale page. On top of that, I also collected the perspectives of our group and wrote the group reflection. On top of that, I represented the whole group to write the Overview, Group Processes and Testing.</p>
            
            <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>3. Group Processes</strong></h1>
            <p>In this project, our group has made an outstanding effort to complete this assignment because we have done our best to keep in touch with each other and we also persuade our teammates to accomplish their tasks before our mini deadlines. On top of that, we divided the tasks equally for everyone. Therefore, finishing all tasks before our mini deadlines was no longer doubtful. Because this semester is the first time we have collaborated with each other, there were some obstacles that we faced. Last but not least, we hope to have more opportunities to collaborate as a team. Therefore, we can improve our skills as well as our performance.</p>
           
            <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>4. Career Plans</strong></h1>
            <p>A common element among our career plans is the desire to work in the field of Information Technology. Each person has chosen this major at RMIT and is interested in pursuing a career in a related field. We would have to take step by step by gaining experience and continuing to learn in order to improve our skills, advance careers and achieve our goals. </p>
            <p>There are also some differences between these career plans. Minh's career plan involves becoming a data scientist and specializing in topics such as data structures, that involves using data to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. While Khai is more interested in web development and software engineering which involves designing and building websites and software applications. Khai is particularly interested in personalizing services and products, and believes that artificial intelligence and machine learning will be key to achieving this goal. Phat's career plan involves working as a website developer and he recognizes the value of experience in this field. Therefore, he plans to work in this role to gain more knowledge and eventually earn a new degree to improve his chances of career advancement. Long is interested in frontend development, which involves designing and building the user interface of websites. He is attracted to the creative aspect of this role and plans to apply for full-time or freelance jobs in this field and potentially transition into teaching. These differences reflect the unique interests and goals of each person in the group.</p>
            <p>Overall, the career plans of this group are somewhat similar, as we all involve working in the field of Information Technology. However, there are also some differences in terms of specific job roles and areas of focus.</p>

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>2. Detail Description</strong></h1>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>A. Aim</strong></h1>
            <p>The aim of our project is to make it simple for our customers to find and buy the gym supplement, equipment, and clothes that best meet their requirements. Most people have a very hard time finding the things that support their fitness objectives. Our website provides a user-friendly platform, packed with pictures and smooth animation that will make it very easy for customers to browse, read reviews and get to choose the product that is best for them.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to create a website that is easy to navigate,with detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and a safe online payment system.Our website is divided into several parts, ranging from supplements to equipment to apparel and PT packs. They are carefully isolated and made as accessible as feasible. Each product will have a separate page with extensive information and pricing to let customers pick what they want.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Making our website as sleek as we can will attract visitors to stay on it longer. Our website is designed in dark mode to make it easier to view for extended periods of time. Each feature has been carefully designed to avoid conflict with others. Customers can find every service they require under one roof. This is highly important because a decent website will encourage users to stay on it longer, increasing the likelihood that they will purchase our product.</p>

        </strong></h1>
        <p>Our team is now using Figma to design and construct a sample version of our website. While the sample version is not a completely functional website, it allows us to present the essential features and functionalities that we intend for the final product. </p>
        <p>The sample website offers an extensive catalog of gym supplements, equipment and fashion clothing from major  manufacturers and distributors, complete with product information, pricing, and all necessary information. Users can compare different items and pick the best solutions for their needs. The website also has a user-friendly interface, clear and simple product descriptions.</p>
        <p>Another website feature is a user-friendly design with clear and simple product descriptions. This makes it simple for consumers to explore the site, locate what they're looking for, and make secure purchases. 
        </p>
        <p>Figma is an amazing tool for building a website for beginners, but it has its limitations. It is hard to make changes when the design is completed. This is due to Figma's limited versatility and customisation as compared to using Github to share our code when working with HTML and CSS. This implies that changing the layout or appearance of the design sometimes necessitates starting from scratch or making considerable changes to the existing design, both of which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.
        </p>
        <p>Product comparison tools and expert evaluations are also available on the website to assist clients in making informed purchasing selections. Customers benefit from these resources because they help them narrow down their selections and find the finest items for their needs.</p>
        <p>While the demo website lacks a full database and other real-world website functionalities, it is a useful prototype for our team to show our process of making a website . We are continuously working to complete the Figma prototype as we try to learn more knowledge about Html, Css and JavaScript in order to construct a website that has all the functionality in the future.
